# Array Manipulation

**Student ID:** [11242706]

## Task 1: Process Array
The `processArray` function accepts an array of numbers as input and outputs a new array with the squared values of all even numbers and tripled values of all odd numbers.

## Task 2: Format Array Strings
The `formatArrayStrings`function accepts two arrays as inputs: a string array and a number array that `processArray` has processed. Every string is altered by the function according to the matching number: if the number is odd, it is converted to lowercase, and if it is even, it is capitalized.

## Task 3: Create User Profiles
The `createUserProfiles` function accepts an array of names as well as the Task 2 modified names array. Each object in the array that it returns has the following properties: {originalName}, `{modifiedName}, and {id} (which is auto-incremented starting at 1).
